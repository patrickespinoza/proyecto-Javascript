        content: `First of all, React is not a JavaScript framework, it's simply a javascript library developed by Jordan Walke
        that helps you to create User Interfaces(UI). React was first used in Facebookâ€™s newsfeed in 2011 and then later in Instagram, WhatsApp by 2012, and released to the public in 2013.
        Today, most of the applications are built using Model View Controller(MVC) architecture and in this MVC architecture React is the 'V' that stands for view.
        In ReactJS, everything is a component and each component is responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. It is mostly used to build reusable components and it reduces the re-rendering of the DOM with the help of Virtual DOM.
